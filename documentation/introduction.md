# What is Jumpsuit?

Simply put, Jumpsuit is a [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) framework.

React itself doesn't include *everything* you'll need to build a real-world application. After all, it's a *library* for building amazing UI interfaces. Out of the gate, you're going to need more than a few essentials to build a full-fledged app and Jumpsuit puts these necessary features at your fingertips with a few simple imports and methods:

- State Management
- Routing
- Associated Boilerplate for "hooking up" everything above

Other useful features you'd expect from a framework are also included and supported in just about any build system

- Redux Dev Tools Integration
- [Hot State Reloading](https://medium.com/@tannerlinsley/introducing-hsr-the-hot-state-reloader-behind-jumpsuit-js-42498712ac90#.jgbssex2z)
