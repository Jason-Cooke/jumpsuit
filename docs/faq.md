# Frequently Asked Questions

---

#### Can I use it with Create React App?
You bet! Jumpsuits CLI is optional. We have instructions below on using just the Jumpsuit framework :)

#### But I've already built an app! Can I still use Jumpsuit?
Of course! Jumpsuit is not an all or nothing framework. You can easily start migrating small parts of your app to use Jumpsuit.

#### I love the state management in Jumpsuit, so can I just use that?
You're probably looking for [Jumpstate](https://github.com/jumpsuit/jumpstate).  We packaged it separately for people just like you :)
